# What’s My Movie Tonight?

Want something to watch? Well, look no further. With “What’s My Movie Tonight?” We solve that problem!

As soon as you get to our site, we immediately take the stress away from having to search for a movie trailer!

Two seconds after the page loads, a random movie trailer from our database will automatically begin to play. 

Next to the video, a box with all of the movie details will be displayed to help you see the information about the movie playing.

Surprise! The movie details are hidden until you mouseover the box to reveal what's behind “FiNd OuT mOrE!”. 

We also have a feature to lookup a movie in our database by entering the title of the movie in the “Enter Title” search bar.

If we have the movie you are looking for in our directory then we will display a summary of the movie.

If we don’t, an error message will pop up signifying we don’t have it in our system yet. 

You can click the red “X” to exit out of the search feature.
