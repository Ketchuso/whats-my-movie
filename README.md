# What’s My Movie Tonight?

What your application does

Why you used the technologies you used

Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

Want something to watch? Well look no further. With “What’s My Movie Tonight?” we solve that problem.

As soon as you get to our site we immediately take the stress away from having to search for a movie trailer.

 2 seconds after the page loads, a random movie trailer from our database will automatically begin to play. 

Next to the video, a box with all of the movie details will be displayed to help you see the information of the movie playing.

Surprise! The movie details are hidden until you mouseover the box to reveal what's behind “FiNd OuT mOrE!”. 

We also have a feature to lookup a movie in our database by entering the title of the movie in the “Enter Title” search bar.

If we have the movie you are looking for in our directory then …..

If we don’t, an error message will pop up signifying we don’t have it in our system yet. 

You can click the red “X” to exit out of the search feature
